# Peer2Peer File Sharing System

A decentralized file-sharing system built in C++ using peer-to-peer networking and Distributed Hash Tables (DHT). This system enables efficient and secure file distribution across nodes without the need for central servers.

## Features

- **Decentralized Network**: Peer-to-peer architecture ensures no central server is required.
- **Distributed Hash Table (DHT)**: Efficiently locates and retrieves files across the network.
- **Node Communication**: Handles connections, data transfer, and file sharing between peers.
- **Scalable**: Easily add or remove nodes without disrupting the network.
- **Secure**: Provides a secure environment for sharing files between nodes.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- C++11 or later

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/ykkalexx/p2p-file-sharing-system
    ```

2. Open the project in Visual Studio:

    - Launch Visual Studio.
    - Select `File` > `Open` > `Project/Solution`.
    - Navigate to the cloned repository and open the `.sln` file.

3. Build the project:

    - In Visual Studio, go to `Build` > `Build Solution` (or press `Ctrl+Shift+B`).

## Usage

1. Start the node and connect to the network.
2. Use the command-line interface to share and retrieve files.
3. Nodes automatically manage the distribution and retrieval of files.
